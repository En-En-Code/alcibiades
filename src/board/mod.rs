//! Facilities for implementing static position evaluation.
//!
//! An evaluation function is used to heuristically determine the
//! relative value of a position, i.e. the chances of winning. If we
//! could see to the end of the game in every line, the evaluation
//! would only have values of "loss", "draw", and "win". In practice,
//! however, we do not know the exact value of a position, so we must
//! make an approximation. Beginning chess players learn to do this
//! starting with the value of the pieces themselves. Computer
//! evaluation functions also use the value of the material as the
//! most significant aspect and then add other considerations.
//!
//! Static evaluation is an evaluation that considers only the static
//! material and positional properties of the current position,
//! without analyzing any tactical variations. Therefore, if the
//! position has pending tactical threats, the static evaluation will
//! be grossly incorrect.
//!
//! Writing a new static evaluator is as simple as defining a type
//! that implements the `BoardEvaluator` trait.
